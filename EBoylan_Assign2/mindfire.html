    <h2> Concept Overview </h2>
    <p> MindFire's concept targets students, professionals and seniors interested in preserving and enhancing
      their memory functions, cognitive abilities and coping skills . It may be of particular benefit to people
      who have suffered a brain injury and need memory re-education.
      The users’ goals are to improve and develop their cognitive functions such as learning, reasoning,
      problem solving, understanding, remembering and paying attention, in an innovative and exciting
      manner. These improvements should result in improved mental health and quality of life.
      Our concept will achieve these objectives by offering: </p>
      <ol class="fadeInUL"> <!-- UL class fadeInUL is to allow lists in body to fade in, but leave lists in navbar -->
        <li> A variety of memory games and puzzles; these activities will strengthen memory and
        cognitive performance by forming adaptable thinking patterns and habits.</li>
        <li> Gamification and inbuilt social interaction features which will track and guide the user's
        progress through an interactive rewards system.</li>
        <li> A sleeping pattern tracker which will help overall memory processing.</li>
        <li> User access to recommended information on diet, exercise and mindfulness via an RSS
        feed-reader.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>
      The core value of our concept is to improve the user’s overall well-being by enhancing and increasing
      their memory functions, cognitive abilities and lifestyle. Reduced brain function is a natural ageing
      process, even in people without medical conditions. Studies show that continued brain stimulation has
      many positive impacts on our general health and brain at any age. Also, regular exercise, good eating
      habits and mindfulness are a natural complement to memory training.</p>

  <div class="col-sm-4 div-with-bg">
    <h2> User Needs </h2>
    <p> MindFire is designed to strengthen memory and cognitive skills. These skills are universally beneficial,
    however they will be of most interest to the following groups:</p>
      <ul class="fadeInUL"> <!-- UL class fadeInUL is to allow lists in body to fade in, but leave lists in navbar -->
        <li> Anyone who wants to improve their mental agility as part of their overall health and personal
        development, or simply enjoys puzzles.</li>
        <li> People who feel the need to improve memory and problem solving to become more effective
        in work, or studying for exams or qualifications.</li>
        <li> People who suffer from memory loss/deterioration due to illness, age or injury and who need
        to develop coping mechanisms to compensate.</li>
      </ul> 
    
    <p>
      With improvements in technology and medicine occurring at a considerable rate, people are living
      longer lives than ever before. Memory loss and dementia are increasingly affecting more people
      worldwide. As research builds a greater awareness and understanding of these conditions, MindFire
      will help people to adopt new habits and behavioural patterns, allowing them to make the most of their
      extended lives.
      By making these challenges easy, intuitive and enjoyable through gamification, we improve the
      chances of these memory enhancements becoming permanent in everyone’s life.
    </p>

    <h2> Functional Scope </h2>
    <p> MindFire allows users to improve their overall brain function through memory and cognitive-based
      games, puzzles and challenges. Tracking results and gamified reward system allow a clear view of
      progression and maintain the user's interest to encourage regular use. Progress is measured against
      personal targets, participating peers or an app-based model based on the user’s profile.
      Social Media integration creates a competitive edge that stimulates the users and can help in building
      a virtual community which is beneficial to psychological well-being.</p>

      <p>The sleeping pattern tracker provides insight into how the user’s sleeping patterns can be improved to
      support better cognitive function.</p>

      <p>The RSS feed-reader allows a user to access multiple information streams to complement their
      training.</p>

      <p>Our concept doesn't compete with medical research or applications. MindFire is not a diagnostic or
      therapeutic application for debilitating mental diseases such as Alzheimer's, dementia or any other
      mental health impairment that affect the memory.</p>

      <p>The roadmap for MindFire is to develop a lifestyle approach to improve memory and overall
      well-being. Cognitive games and regular sleep can improve memory, but the holistic approach brings
      it to the next level. To complement the RSS feed-reader, and provide more targeted lifestyle advice,
      we plan on creating API's allowing integration with recommended apps that offer relaxation
      techniques, mindfulness, physical activities and dietary advice. We are not looking to develop multiple
      apps. The aim of the project is to improve memory and cognitive function, supported by suggested
      lifestyle changes. </p>
